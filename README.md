# Rainbow-Six-Full-Cheat-Source (Overflow Cheats)
###### Just a long project which I stopped working on. Can bypass most anti-cheats with the only detection vector being the creation of a system thread.

- **If your going to use this its not ready to paste, you'll need to setup a MySql database, preferably from Microsofts Azure service (ez and cheap).** 
     - Once thats done fill in your cridentials in the login.cpp file, and now you should have a working loader (make sure to set-up the tables correctly in the db).
